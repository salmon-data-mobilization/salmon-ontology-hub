# Salmon Ontology Development WG Statement of Work

# Working Group Charter

The **Salmon Ontology Development Working Group** will develop a scalable, community-driven method to support salmon biologists and data stewards in publishing controlled vocabularies and ontology modules that align with a broader pre-existing salmon domain ontology. The WG will deliver three key outcomes within 18 months:

1. **Establish a reusable, community-informed process to integrate salmon datasets using knowledge models** that formalize the semantics required to analyze salmon data across agencies. These models will be designed to support a representative fisheries management and research question and will be demonstrated through a case study that typifies common challenges in data integration.
2. **Create an open-access training resource to model salmon knowledge** that teaches scientists and data professionals how to use pre-existing tools and the method we develop to formally define terms used by their agency/organization/program, integrate data from disparate sources, and contribute and align their ontology modules into a broader salmon domain ontology.
3. **Deliver a workshop to train fisheries scientists** to employ, test, and refine this process and training resource towards the latter stages of this WG.

We will use [an illustrative case study](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1myb-EsbtiJS7-x5wyuzMT9anrQyFC6zELy-WwykChRE/edit?tab=t.0) to select appropriate datasets and constrain the thematic scope of our salmon knowledge modeling process. This will ensure the process remains focused and tractable while addressing meaningful real-world integration challenges. The resulting approach will inform the development of a workshop-based training module that can be applied by others in their own contexts.

The selected case study exemplifies common semantic and data integration challenges that salmon biologists and analysts encounter when collaborating across different jurisdictions:

**How does variation in juvenile \[_any salmon species here_\] salmon condition across regions and years relate to population trends in \[xyz region\]?**

# Value Proposition

The working group will operate in parallel workstreams: developing modular ontologies and building training materials through applied case studies.

It builds on lessons from salmon data challenges and insights from ontology engineering, aiming to balance pragmatic needs of field biologists and analysts with the rigor required for formal knowledge representation.

This process will be designed to:

- Enable interoperability of key salmon-related data across jurisdictions and institutions
- Provide a low-barrier, high-value path to vocabulary alignment that supports downstream ontology integration
- Empower agencies and community members to participate in defining and maintaining terms, relationships, and metadata in a transparent and collaborative way
- Guide the development of modular, machine-readable vocabularies and ontologies that are aligned with existing resources like the [NCEAS Salmon Ontology](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/SALMON)

This process answers the question: **"How can I (as an agency/academic/NGO salmon biologist, researcher, or data steward) make my salmon-related data easier to share, compare, and understand across projects, agencies, or regions?"**

It begins when someone hits a common friction point:

- You're asked to share or publish a dataset but aren’t sure how to explain your field names
- You want to reuse or compare someone else’s data, but their terminology is unfamiliar
- You’re building a dashboard or model and notice similar data is structured or labeled differently

Whether preparing for collaboration, data reuse, or public release, this process helps define terms clearly, align with others, and set data up for future integration. It supports a structured but adaptable way to build vocabularies and contribute to larger efforts like the NCEAS Salmon Ontology.

This WG directly benefits the **salmon science and management community**, including:

- Government fisheries scientists and data managers.
- Academic researchers in salmon ecology and population dynamics.
- Indigenous guardians and knowledge holders involved in monitoring and co-management.
- NGO’s and grassroots initiatives focused on salmon conservation, education, and management.

By producing both a technical recommendation and practical training materials, the WG empowers these stakeholders to:

- Align datasets semantically across programs and agencies.
- Enable machine-readable knowledge representation of key metrics and observational data.
- Facilitate cross-jurisdictional data integration and advanced discovery.

These outcomes support better-informed decisions in salmon conservation, stock assessment, and habitat monitoring.

# Engagement with Existing Work in the Area

The WG will engage with and build on:

- The NCEAS Salmon Ontology (hosted on BioPortal).
- ENVO and other OBO Foundry ontologies.
- Linked data vocabularies such as SKOS and OWL.
- Tools like ROBOT, LinkML, and WebProtégé, Github, Wikimedia

We will coordinate with:

- The RDA Salmon Research and Monitoring Data Interest Group
- The RDA Vocabulary Services Interest Group.
- The RDA InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology WG.
- ESIP Semantic Technology Committee (as observer or collaborator).
- Fisheries and aquatic data initiatives globally.

# UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

The WG supports:

- **Goal 14** (Life Below Water) by enhancing interoperability of salmon-related data to improve conservation and sustainable use of aquatic resources.
- **Goal 15** (Life on Land) through better monitoring of freshwater ecosystems linked to salmon.
- **Goal 17** (Partnerships for the Goals) by fostering international cooperation across data producers, stewards, and users.

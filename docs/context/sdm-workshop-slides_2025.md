# FISHING FOR CLARITY: KNOWLEDGE MODELING TO  SUPPORT CROSS- ORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION AND DATA SHARING ABOUT SALMON ESCAPEMENT
2025 WA-BC Annual Meeting
Beyond Borders: Connecting Communities, People and Fish

### Notes:
●	Problem Statement: Salmon management and research are often fragmented across different domains and stakeholders. Data are defined, scoped, and measured differently in local and broad-scale research contexts. This workshop aims to pilot a knowledge modeling approach to address these challenges.
●	Workshop Objectives:
○	Introduce the general approach
○	Start working on a specific context (cross-border escapement data)
○	Develop a commitment to follow up and complete the work following the workshop
Outcome: Understand the workshop’s context and objectives.

### Notes:
Speaker Guidelines that we gave Nancy
We invite you to present a demonstration of your work integrating salmon data, with a focus on the challenges and solutions related to harmonizing terms and definitions across disparate data sources.
Specifically, we ask you to address the following:
Term Mapping & Standardization: How did you approach mapping measurement terms from different datasets? Did you establish your own data dictionary or controlled vocabularies or adapt existing ones? What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?
Interoperability Across Organizations: If you had to integrate your data with a completely administratively independent organization—one with no shared governance, policies, or infrastructure—how would you approach it? And how might you sustain it as new data is generated?

<!-- Slide number: 34 -->
# Challenges and Solutions in Real Life Data Integrations

Format:

The goal of the analysis and data cleaning effort
The main concepts you were looking to calculate from the data.  These could include things like total sampling effort or percentage of the populations covered.
What data elements were used in the analyses
Why they were hard to pull together
Any unresolved issues you couldn’t fix with the data in NuSEDS

### Notes:

Best Available data, Reporting Deadlines, Reproducibility, Transparency
Collaborating on regional data standards and accessibility leverages individual projects and investments, improves the understanding of regional recovery and restoration efforts and provides an accessible, reproducible foundation for management decisions.
Focused on improving access to priority fish information to inform research and decision-making across the Pacific Northwest, with origins in the Columbia River Basin.

Abstract: To support management and recovery of salmon and steelhead, significant efforts have been made to enhance access to information about these species for the Columbia River Basin and the wider Pacific Northwest. A number of data systems have been developed to support structured data sharing among multiple partners, including Tribes, federal and state agencies. This data standardization and accessibility has allowed the development of automated tools for data access and processing, facilitating open, reproducible science. For example, the Coordinated Assessments data exchange (CAX), supported by the Coordinated Assessments Partnership (CAP), provides a system for sharing high level indicators such as Natural Origin Spawner Abundance (NOSA), Recruits per Spawner (R/S) and Smolt to Adult Returns (SAR).  Recently the CAX was expanded to include hatchery data, including hatchery program information, SARs for hatchery runs, and hatchery releases.

# 2010 Regional Data Sharing Principles
We want to improve data sharing to enable access to timely data, improve data quality, and reduce the data management burden in order to support better regional assessments and management decisions.

In order to achieve this, the agencies and tribes will:
Support local control and management of key primary data consistent with regional assessment and reporting needs.
Exchange indicators in common format regardless of original format or coding, and regardless of sampling methodologies.
Prioritize sharing the data necessary to support regional assessments and reporting.
Provide enough information about the data to support understanding and replication of the derivation of indicators for secondary applications and assessment needs.
 Work towards automated exchange to increase speed and efficiency of data sharing and to reduce individual workload.

### Notes:

### Notes:

The workshop attendees were asked whether any of the additional five Hatchery Stock Indicators provided by pre-workshop survey respondents should be added to the existing list of nine Hatchery Stock Indicators. Based on the poll results, “Age at Return” was added. The resulting ten Hatchery Stock Indicators were ranked as follows by the workshop attendees, with #1 being ranked the highest:

Process for the ad hoc input session:
Do 1st:
describe relationship to existing and draft
discuss new items (last 2 in list)
what is reasonable?
prioritize based on what is feasible based on availably of data

A real life example of data integration with CAX and other data sources – from Eli Holmes presentation to the PNAMP Fish Monitoring Work Group Meeting April 2022

ELI’S TALKING NOTES (from her pres)
Best Available data, Reporting Deadlines, Reproducibility, Transparency
Collaborating on regional data standards and accessibility leverages individual projects and investments, improves the understanding of regional recovery and restoration efforts and provides an accessible, reproducible foundation for management decisions.
Focused on improving access to priority fish information to inform research and decision-making across the Pacific Northwest, with origins in the Columbia River Basin.

Abstract: To support management and recovery of salmon and steelhead, significant efforts have been made to enhance access to information about these species for the Columbia River Basin and the wider Pacific Northwest. A number of data systems have been developed to support structured data sharing among multiple partners, including Tribes, federal and state agencies. This data standardization and accessibility has allowed the development of automated tools for data access and processing, facilitating open, reproducible science. For example, the Coordinated Assessments data exchange (CAX), supported by the Coordinated Assessments Partnership (CAP), provides a system for sharing high level indicators such as Natural Origin Spawner Abundance (NOSA), Recruits per Spawner (R/S) and Smolt to Adult Returns (SAR).  Recently the CAX was expanded to include hatchery data, including hatchery program information, SARs for hatchery runs, and hatchery releases.

# Data Integration Process

![CAP-Logo](GoogleShape1082g33ddc2ed7ab_1_484.jpg)

Understand what is in the new partner system
Human programming approach to understand compatibility
Crosswalk terms and definitions
Write scripts that would extract data, transform as needed, align with existing
Create a tool that would allow the user to discover, choose, aggregate, download on user space

### Notes:
Notes from Eli’s “Data Issues” slide…might be useful to mention relative to understanding what is in the new system, compatibility etc.
The fraction wild data are problematic
No information on how fraction wild was estimated. Was this a sample? How big?
In quite a few cases, the fraction wild data are clearly an estimate detached from a sample. For example, if fraction wild = 0.2 for 10 years straight, that is not an estimate from a sample.
Quality Grade?
Currently we have no system to grade the confidence in the data.
Would be good to convey data quality.
We have regions where we have multiple estimation methods
Survey and multiple model estimates
Will need to decide how to deal with this. Statistically we can easily combine multiple estimates

# Bruno Carturan and the New Salmon Escapement Data System (NuSEDS)
Bruno Carturan is a computational ecologist interested in topics including biodiversity and resilience, employing a diverse range of modelling approaches. He earned his PhD from the University of British Columbia (UBC Okanagan), where he explored the relationship between the functional diversity of coral reef communities and their resilience using an agent-based modelling framework. He later did a postdoc where modelled bumble bee population dynamics and the pollination services they provide in agricultural landscapes. Since 2023, he has worked as an analyst for the Pacific Salmon Foundation (PSF), where he has mostly focused on optimizing data workflows for the salmon population-related data featured in the Pacific Salmon Explorer (PSE).

Important Reminders about nuSEDS

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 60 -->
Important Reminders about nuSEDS (My Perspective)
nuSEDS uses “POP_ID” but these are not really population estimates, they are “survey records for assessment programs that DFO Stock Assessment implements or collaborates on” (mostly, but not always)

Some spawner surveys are done by Salmon Enhancement Program, and go into a different database (EPAD), but some of these also go into nuSEDS.

In some cases, Survey Record = Population Estimate, but can’t assume that this holds, and can’t currently determine from the information in nuSEDS where that applies

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 61 -->
Important Reminders about nuSEDS (My Perspective)

Survey program evolves over time, resulting in changing “POP_ID”, while still covering the same population.

Lots of  POP_ID are for exploratory surveys (especially 1990s to early 2000s) or “rotating spot-checks” that happen every few years to look for shifting distribution

Lots of POP_ID are for different surveys on the same population

Different agencies, and different projects within the same agency, may use very different definitions for “population”, “stock”, “stock aggregate”

 Lots of pitfalls when trying to match nuSEDS survey records to population spawner estimates from another agency

Comparison: What is the final data product?
Southern BC Chinook
Consistent index of wild spawner abundance (~40 CUs)
For most CUs don’t currently scale up to total abundance, and currently don’t get estimates of recruits

Stikine Sockeye
Stock-level spawners and recruits for SR model (2 stocks)

Yukon Chinook
Cleaned inputs of survey data for use in the combined run reconstruction and spawner-recruit model, which then generates stock-level time series of spawners and recruits. (originally for 3 stocks, currently working on transition to CU level for Canadian stock)

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 73 -->
Comparison: How does nuSEDS fit into the picture?
Southern BC Chinook
Automated data processing starts with nuSEDS, but merges in other data sources and applies supplemental information

Stikine Sockeye
Some of the survey data is in nuSEDS, but the project relied on local files.
One of the stock-level estimates is calculated as an expansion of the other, based on stock proportion estimates that are not in nuSEDS.

Yukon Chinook
Some of the survey data for the Canadian part is in nuSEDS, but the project worked through an intensive data review process (~30 contributors) to build an agreed-upon source data set separately from nuSEDS.

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 77 -->
Record Merging Across Formal Databases (SBC Chinook only)
For each site and year, check through nuSEDS, EPAD (Salmon Enhancement Program), and the 2012 verified record set.

If only 1 of these sources has a record, use it

If there is more than 1 value, then
use nuSEDS over EPAD for spawner estimates
use EPAD over nuSEDS for broodstock estimates
use the 2012 verified record over the other sources unless the nuSEDS record is date stamped after 2012

After the 2020 update, the merged data set included 5,718 records for 311 sites, compared to the 5,089 numeric records in the raw nuSEDS data. (~12% more records)

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 78 -->
Record Alignment in nuSEDS (SBC Chinook only)
nuSEDS assigns a ‘popID’ to each data series, but these don’t actually reflect salmon populations. They are really ‘survey IDs’
Over time multiple survey IDs can refer to the same population
For example:
Used to do 2 tributary surveys (popID 1 and popID 2)
Then switched to mainstem estimate (popID 3), but have some years of overlap.
To get a meaningful series for the population, need to sum popID 1 and popID 2 for the early years (and possibly scale up based on observed ratio from overlap years), and assign those generated values to popID 3
Important not to double count fish in the overlap years!

This kind of stuff is impossible to catch purely within nuSEDS based on current data fields. Need to vet data for each CU with local experts before using it.

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 79 -->
Record Classification/Rating
SBC Chinook
nuSEDS has an ESTIMATE_CLASSIFICATION (Type1 to Type 6) and various fields for estimation method (ESTIMATE_METHOD, ENUMERATION_METHOD1 to ENUMERATION_METHOD6)
Using the ESTIMATE_CLASSIFICATION to filter out low quality records (drop Type 5,6)
Haven’t been able to build a consistent rating/taxonomy of the enumeration method fields.

Yukon Chinook
Compiled Use = T/F rating for each record in each contributed series, with a brief explanation for each Use = F
These ratings and explanations don’t currently make it back into the DFO or ADFG regional databases, but existing data structure would fit into a regional data system (but don’t have them for any other species/area)

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 80 -->
Series Classification/Rating
SBC Chinook
In addition to the quality filtering of individual records, also compiled additional information for each survey site (popID):
Site classification: Persistent, DD (insufficient records to use for index), Agg (double counting), Del (errors)
Enhancement classification: H/M/L/UNK (with detailed guidelines)
Start year: first year for which data has been verified
Only use persistent sites with L/UNK enhancement after start year to construct the spawner index
These ratings could go into a regional database (but don’t have for any other species/area)

use nuSEDS over EPAD for spawner estimates
use EPAD over nuSEDS for broodstock estimates
use the 2012 verified record over the other sources unless the nuSEDS record is date stamped after 2012

After the 2020 update, the merged data set included 5,718 records for 311 sites, compared to the 5,089 numeric records in the raw nuSEDS data. (~12% more records)

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 104 -->
Record Alignment in nuSEDS (SBC Chinook only)
nuSEDS assigns a ‘popID’ to each data series, but these don’t actually reflect salmon populations. They are really ‘survey IDs’
Over time multiple survey IDs can refer to the same population
For example:
Used to do 2 tributary surveys (popID 1 and popID 2)
Then switched to mainstem estimate (popID 3), but have some years of overlap.
To get a meaningful series for the population, need to sum popID 1 and popID 2 for the early years (and possibly scale up based on observed ratio from overlap years), and assign those generated values to popID 3
Important not to double count fish in the overlap years!

This kind of stuff is impossible to catch purely within nuSEDS based on current data fields. Need to vet data for each CU with local experts before using it.

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 105 -->
Record Classification/Rating
SBC Chinook
nuSEDS has an ESTIMATE_CLASSIFICATION (Type1 to Type 6) and various fields for estimation method (ESTIMATE_METHOD, ENUMERATION_METHOD1 to ENUMERATION_METHOD6)
Using the ESTIMATE_CLASSIFICATION to filter out low quality records (drop Type 5,6)
Haven’t been able to build a consistent rating/taxonomy of the enumeration method fields.

Yukon Chinook
Compiled Use = T/F rating for each record in each contributed series, with a brief explanation for each Use = F
These ratings and explanations don’t currently make it back into the DFO or ADFG regional databases, but existing data structure would fit into a regional data system (but don’t have them for any other species/area)

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 106 -->
Series Classification/Rating
SBC Chinook
In addition to the quality filtering of individual records, also compiled additional information for each survey site (popID):
Site classification: Persistent, DD (insufficient records to use for index), Agg (double counting), Del (errors)
Enhancement classification: H/M/L/UNK (with detailed guidelines)
Start year: first year for which data has been verified
Only use persistent sites with L/UNK enhancement after start year to construct the spawner index
These ratings could go into a regional database (but don’t have for any other species/area)

Important Reminders about nuSEDS

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 111 -->
Important Reminders about nuSEDS (My Perspective)
nuSEDS uses “POP_ID” but these are not really population estimates, they are “survey records for assessment programs that DFO Stock Assessment implements or collaborates on” (mostly, but not always)

Some spawner surveys are done by Salmon Enhancement Program, and go into a different database (EPAD), but some of these also go into nuSEDS.

In some cases, Survey Record = Population Estimate, but can’t assume that this holds, and can’t currently determine from the information in nuSEDS where that applies

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 112 -->
Important Reminders about nuSEDS (My Perspective)

Survey program evolves over time, resulting in changing “POP_ID”, while still covering the same population.

Lots of  POP_ID are for exploratory surveys (especially 1990s to early 2000s) or “rotating spot-checks” that happen every few years to look for shifting distribution

Lots of POP_ID are for different surveys on the same population

Different agencies, and different projects within the same agency, may use very different definitions for “population”, “stock”, “stock aggregate”

 Lots of pitfalls when trying to match nuSEDS survey records to population spawner estimates from another agency

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 113 -->
High-level Overview

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 114 -->
Example 1: Southern BC Chinook CU-level Spawner Estimates
Highlights
Assessment focus is on indicator sites
Built and used a code base to go from ‘raw’ nuSEDS to usable, peer-reviewed estimates of CU-level index of wild spawner abundance.
Lots of supplementary information needed to filter and process the nuSEDS records
Periodic data updates coordinated regionally over the last 15 years.

General Data Integration Challenges
Who keeps the supplementary information up to date across areas?
Who maintains the code base?
Who coordinates methods updates? (e.g., hatchery influence)

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 115 -->
Example 1: Southern BC Chinook CU-level Spawner Estimates
->  Will show a data treatment illustration later (need some more details first)

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 116 -->
Example 2: Stikine Sockeye
Highlights
Typical example of northern transboundary stocks
Assessment focus is on border passage
Stock-level data are then parsed out based on surveys for some tributaries, stock ID at the border, and/or “Border Minus X”.

General Data Integration Challenges
Which pieces are ‘raw’ data for regional database?
How to build CU-level data?

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 123 -->
Comparison: What is the final data product?
Southern BC Chinook
Consistent index of wild spawner abundance (~40 CUs)
For most CUs don’t currently scale up to total abundance, and currently don’t get estimates of recruits

Stikine Sockeye
Stock-level spawners and recruits for SR model (2 stocks)

Yukon Chinook
Cleaned inputs of survey data for use in the combined run reconstruction and spawner-recruit model, which then generates stock-level time series of spawners and recruits. (originally for 3 stocks, currently working on transition to CU level for Canadian stock)

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 124 -->
Comparison: How does nuSEDS fit into the picture?
Southern BC Chinook
Automated data processing starts with nuSEDS, but merges in other data sources and applies supplemental information

Stikine Sockeye
Some of the survey data is in nuSEDS, but the project relied on local files.
One of the stock-level estimates is calculated as an expansion of the other, based on stock proportion estimates that are not in nuSEDS.

Yukon Chinook
Some of the survey data for the Canadian part is in nuSEDS, but the project worked through an intensive data review process (~30 contributors) to build an agreed-upon source data set separately from nuSEDS.

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 125 -->
Comparison: What was the single biggest data challenge?
Southern BC Chinook
Process: developing, compiling and maintaining the supplementary information required to select, filter, and infill the records to generate consistent index series

Stikine Sockeye
Process: bilateral record review and verification

Yukon Chinook
Process: coordinating among large number of data contributors and data reviewers while feeding latest version to the modelling team (csv files + R code + github, no databases)

### Notes:

Specific Database and Metadata Challenges

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 127 -->
General ‘Metadata’
Southern BC Chinook
Choices hardwired into the data processing code (e.g., infilling method, quality filtering)

Stikine Sockeye
Detailed data treatment flowcharts for each key variable

Yukon Chinook
Detailed description of each survey program. (How could long text like this fit into a regional data system?)
Inventory of major changes for each survey (csv tables, could be incorporated in a database)

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 128 -->
Record Merging Across Formal Databases (SBC Chinook only)
For each site and year, check through nuSEDS, EPAD (Salmon Enhancement Program), and the 2012 verified record set.

If only 1 of these sources has a record, use it

If there is more than 1 value, then
use nuSEDS over EPAD for spawner estimates
use EPAD over nuSEDS for broodstock estimates
use the 2012 verified record over the other sources unless the nuSEDS record is date stamped after 2012

After the 2020 update, the merged data set included 5,718 records for 311 sites, compared to the 5,089 numeric records in the raw nuSEDS data. (~12% more records)

### Notes:
OBJECTIVE 1:

1. Assess Conceptual Coverage – Identify missing or redundant concepts in SALON.
2. Improve Classification & Hierarchy – Optimize the structure for better semantic clarity.
3. Refine Concept Naming & Definitions – Ensure consistent, precise, and intuitive terminology.
4. Determine Granularity & Scope – Define appropriate levels of specificity and abstraction.
5. Leverage Existing Ontologies – Identify reusable standards or models (e.g., FAO, ENVO).
6. Enable Modularization & Interoperability – Structure the ontology for flexibility and integration.

To highlight after Objective 2 that implementing quality control measures, applying community-driven evaluation (expert review, feedback loop), how we want to document and implement a governance model will be discussed in Session 4.

# Background for Concept Decomposition
Concepts in cognition are abstract mental representations of how humans understand and categorize concrete things or abstract ideas.
Concepts in database systems are the fundamental building blocks for organizing and managing data. These include:
entities (e.g., Salmon),
relationships (e.g., Salmon inhabits Spawning_Site), and
attributes (e.g., Species_Name), which describe the properties or characteristics of these entities.

Copulative constructions contains verbs that may express identity, membership of a class, or some specific relation. E.g., “Salmon and trout,” refer to “salmon” and “trout” as two separate entities, rather than one defining or modifying the other. This information is available in the metadata descriptions or definitions of datasets.

OBOE (the Extensible Observation Ontology) as a meta-framework for concept decomposition.
Entity: An object (e.g., a tree, a community, an ecological process) that is the focus of an observation.
Observation:  An assertion that an entity was observed to estimate or calculate a value of its characteristic property.
Characteristic: A measurable property of an entity (e.g., age, length, or color).
Measurement: An assertion that a characteristic of an entity had a particular value during an observation event.
Measurement Type: Defines the type of measurement, following a protocol to record a characteristic value of an entity.

# Example of Concept Decomposition
NuSEDS: STREAM_ARRIVAL_DT_FROM
“This is the spawning start date for a population for the current season, where start means fish are beginning to pair on the spawning grounds, schools of fish may be holding (pools or mouth) and there are very few, if any, carcasses or redds. Fish are generally in the lower sections of the normal spawning area and may be bright with no fungus and have no white-coloured, eroded fins”.

There is an observation for an entity that is salmon population group
that is of species type Chinook,
including live and dead individuals,
that indicate the arrival of a population during a time period (i.e., season),
at a particular physical or geographical location (i.e., spawning ground)
on a particular date (i.e., spawning start date),
and is indicative of a measurement type (i.e., biological process of spawning),
and the fish has certain physical characteristics indicating its health (i.e., bright, no fungus).

# GUIDE FOR HANDS-ON SESSION
3 Breakout groups, each will work on one dataset:
Group 1: NuSEDs (Group leader - Emma, Gottfried, Tom, Lara)
Group 2: SALHub (Group leaders - Brett, Scott, Matt)
Group 3: Streamnet CAX NOSA (Group leaders - Jen, Sam, Shirly) online group
Activity 1:  1:00 -1:30 pm (30 mins)
Use conceptual decomposition to identify core concepts vocabulary in three datasets. (30 mins)
Activity 2:  1:30 -2:00 pm (30 mins)
Use hierarchical clustering to group similar concepts and classify them into broader categories.
For all participants, see dataset vocabulary in shared Google Drive folder here
For group leaders, see Mural Board for note-taking here:
https://shorturl.at/4Xcrq
https://shorturl.at/1FvRK

### Notes:
OBJECTIVE 1:

1. Assess Conceptual Coverage – Identify missing or redundant concepts in SALON.
2. Improve Classification & Hierarchy – Optimize the structure for better semantic clarity.
3. Refine Concept Naming & Definitions – Ensure consistent, precise, and intuitive terminology.
4. Determine Granularity & Scope – Define appropriate levels of specificity and abstraction.
5. Leverage Existing Ontologies – Identify reusable standards or models (e.g., FAO, ENVO).
6. Enable Modularization & Interoperability – Structure the ontology for flexibility and integration.

To highlight after Objective 2 that implementing quality control measures, applying community-driven evaluation (expert review, feedback loop), how we want to document and implement a governance model will be discussed in Session 4.

# FISHING FOR CLARITY: KNOWLEDGE MODELING TO  SUPPORT CROSS- ORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION AND DATA SHARING ABOUT SALMON ESCAPEMENT
Hands-on Concept Mapping for Salmon Data

Shirly Stephen,
National Center for Ecological Synthesis and Analysis, University of California
2025 WA-BC Annual Meeting
Beyond Borders: Connecting Communities, People and Fish

### Notes:
Format: Hands-On Workshop
Challenge: The concepts identified so far need a formal structure and computer language to show how they are related and to ensure clarity.
Goal: Formalize the structure of the ontology, organizing terms into hierarchical relationships and aligning overlapping concepts. Concretize into a formal ontology language.
Facilitators: Ontology Engineers
Part 1: Introduction to basic ontology design principles.
Use tools like Protégé or spreadsheets to organize terms.
Part 2: Group activity: Refine concepts into classes, subclasses, and relationships. Outcome: Participants become familiar with how to use patterns designed in previous session to build re- usable ontologies for their own query needs.

in order to understand an observation, what is needed?

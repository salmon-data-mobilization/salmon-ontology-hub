## Working Group

We are the **Salmon Ontology Development Working Group**, operating under the **Research Data Alliance (RDA) Salmon Monitoring & Research Interest Group**. The WG’s goal is to develop a community-led, reusable method for aligning salmon datasets via controlled vocabularies and ontology modules.

### Scope

- Build a repeatable process for term alignment, vocabulary publication, and ontology module integration.
- Provide training materials and workshops to help researchers and data stewards apply the method.
- Maintain alignment with established resources like the NCEAS Salmon Ontology.

### Deliverables (18 months)

- A documented, repeatable method for ontology module creation.
- Open training materials and a workshop curriculum.
- A pilot workshop + published recommendation.

### Schedule (high level)

- **Month 1 (Feb 2026):** Use-case brief + requirements
- **Month 3 (Mar 2026):** Dataset-specific modeling draft
- **Month 6:** Case study + workshop outline
- **Month 9:** Alpha training materials + community review
- **Month 12:** Final training materials + draft recommendation
- **Month 15:** Pilot workshop + revisions
- **Month 18:** Final recommendation published

### Community & Coordination

We coordinate via the RDA Salmon IG and community channels, using GitHub for open issues and deliverables.

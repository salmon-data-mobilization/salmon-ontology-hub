## Purpose

The Salmon Domain Ontology provides shared vocabulary and conceptual structure for salmon data across agencies, regions, and programs. It supports discoverability, interoperability, and consistent interpretation.

## Scope

This ontology focuses on:

- Species, life stages, and populations
- Habitats and ecosystem context
- Observations, sampling, and monitoring programs
- Data governance and provenance metadata

## Structure (placeholder)

This section will document core classes, relationships, and key terms once formalized.
